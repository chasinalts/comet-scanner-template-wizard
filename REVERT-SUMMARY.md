# Revert to Checkpoint 8 Summary

## What We've Done

1. **Identified Checkpoint 8**:
   - Located commit `7d824da` with message "Fix React hooks imports to use react-imports.ts instead of direct imports"
   - This commit represents Checkpoint 8 in the project's history

2. **Created Restore Branches**:
   - Created `checkpoint-8-restore` branch at the exact commit point
   - Created `new-main` branch from the same commit point with additional documentation

3. **Verified Project Functionality**:
   - Installed dependencies with `npm install`
   - Successfully built the project with `npm run build`
   - The project compiles without errors

4. **Added Documentation**:
   - Created `CHECKPOINT-8-RESTORE.md` with details about the current state
   - Created this summary document

## Current State

The project is now reverted to using Supabase for authentication and database functionality, with the following key components:

- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with custom user profiles
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL database
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage for image management
- **UI Framework**: React with TailwindCSS and Framer Motion

## Next Steps

To complete the reversion process:

1. **Set the New Main Branch as Default**:
   - Go to GitHub repository settings
   - Change the default branch from `main` to `new-main`
   - Alternatively, you can rename `new-main` to `main` with:
     ```bash
     git branch -m main old-main        # Rename local main to old-main
     git branch -m new-main main        # Rename new-main to main
     git push -f origin main            # Force push the new main
     ```

2. **Update Supabase Configuration**:
   - Verify the Supabase project is still active
   - Check that the tables and storage buckets exist
   - Update RLS policies if needed

3. **Deploy the Reverted Version**:
   - Deploy to Netlify using the `netlify:build` script
   - Verify the deployment works correctly

## Important Notes

- The `.env` file contains Supabase credentials that should be kept secure
- The project now requires Node.js version 18.x (as specified in package.json)
- The authentication flow is different from the Appwrite implementation
- You may need to recreate user accounts in Supabase
