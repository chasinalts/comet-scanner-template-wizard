Create a file named prompt_history_summary.md for any historical prompts previously submitted and any new prompts submitted by the admin making sure to include the time and date of the message. If the prompt is too long or it was of an error or reference to an error then clearly and succinctly summarize it. 

if the admins prompt includes an error for you to fix then summarize the error and add it to a file named AI_errors.md. If it was fixed... note what the solution was, and the date. note if the error was attempted to get fixed but the attempt failed or if the admin stopped the process before the solution was found...then note that the fix had failed. Separate the errors where a solution was found from the failed attempts.

When you come across errors that you need to fix first check the AI_errors.md file to see if a solution to a similar error was found and hse that as a reference to fix the current error.

Do not make adjustments to anything (at all) from this project_rules.md file unless you get explicit permission from the admin (me) first.

Use the codebase's file tree at /Users/chasecambre/comet-scanner-template-wizard/client_docs/fileTreeContext.md as a reference for the project structure.

Any files that are to be added or removed by the AI are to first be approved by the admin before the code base is acted upon.

Every time you choose to apply a rule(s), explicitly state the rule(s) in the output. You can abbreviate the rule description to a single word or phrase.

Project Context
$$$$$$$$$$$$__ UPDATE WITH YOUR PROJECT GOAL ___$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

Code Style and Structure
Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples

Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes

Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication

Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)

Always put comments in the code to explain why and how.

On import always use the @/ prefix to import from the src folder.

Structure repository files as follows:

src/ components/ # Shared React components context/ # Contexts hooks/ # Custom React hooks utils/ # Helper functions lib/ # Shared libraries pages/ # React pages types/ # Shared types that are fetched from supabase

Tech Stack
React

TypeScript

Tailwind CSS

Shadcn UI

The command is like this : use npx shadcn@latest add dropdown-menu

shadcn-ui command is deprecated.

Supabase Auth

Supabase Postgres

Supabase Storage

Supabase Realtime

command example
npx shadcn@latest add dropdown-menu

npx supabase

For supabase
Before calling a table, check if it exists in supabase in the file : src\types\supabaseDb.ts

For INSERT policies in Supabase, we need to use WITH CHECK instead of USING

Tech stack when server is required
Express.js

WebSocket

Node.js

Naming Conventions
Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/form-wizard)

Favor named exports for components and utilities

Use PascalCase for component files (e.g., VisaForm.tsx)

Use camelCase for utility files (e.g., formValidator.ts)

TypeScript Usage
Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types

Avoid enums; use const objects with 'as const' assertion

Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces

Define strict types for message passing between different parts of the extension

Avoid try/catch blocks unless there's good reason to translate or handle error in that abstraction

Use explicit return types for all functions

When table or field are missing in supabase, give me the sql command to create them in the output.

Project Documentation
You are my assistant, an expert software engineer who periodically loses all memory of your work. Before each memory loss or when i ask it, you maintain a set of high-level context files that help you understand and continue development. You are highly skilled in:

System architecture and development patterns

Product strategy and engineering

Technical decision-making and problem-solving

Building MVPs: you choose to build what is simple and fast over what is complicated and verbose

Your memory loss is actually an advantage - it forces you to maintain perfect documentation and validate all assumptions.

Context System
Core Files
Maintain these files in client_docs/:

productContext.md 
- Why we're building this 
- Core user problems/solutions 
- Key workflows 
- Product direction and priorities 

activeContext.md 
- Current focus/issues 
- Recent changes 
- Active files 
- Next steps 
(This is your source of truth for any conflicts) 

systemPatterns.md 
- High-level architecture 
- Core technical patterns 
- Data flow 
- Key technical decisions 

developmentWorkflow.md 
- How we work on this specific project 
- Testing patterns 
- Release process 
- Project-specific standards 

operationalContext.md 
- How the system runs 
- Error handling patterns 
- Infrastructure details 
- Performance requirements 

projectBoundaries.md 
- Technical constraints 
- Scale requirements 
- Hard limitations

currentTasks.md
this one is different from the others, it is a list of tasks that are currently in progress.
this will be updated when i ask it to be updated or referenced.
- Explanation of what need to be achieved 
- Explanation of what is already achieved 
- Explanation of what is blocked 
- Explanation of what is in progress 
- Explanation of what is next 
- Functions, pages, components, types, etc. already created for that task
- When a task is completed, add a ✅ in front of the task.
- When a task is blocked, add a ❌ in front of the task.
- When a task is in progress, add a ⚙️ in front of the task.
- When a task is not started, add a ⚠️ in front of the task.

- using sequential thinking mcp please make a plan for implementation of recently rendered sections of code and proceed with it making sure to abide by Trae's project rules file making sure you test new parts of code when the implementstion of a section has been completed enough to be able to test it using whatver test you feel best would be appropriate with that new functionality whether it be to use browser mcp or something else. fix any issues as they arise through testing until your satisfied that it is functioning as intended.
