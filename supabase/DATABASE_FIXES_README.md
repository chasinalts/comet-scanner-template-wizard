# Database Fixes for COMET Scanner Admin Dashboard

This directory contains SQL scripts to fix the database issues identified during admin dashboard testing.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Database Columns
- ❌ `column templates.is_active does not exist`
- ❌ `column code_snippets.is_active does not exist`
- ✅ **Fixed**: Added `is_active` columns to both tables

### 2. Row Level Security (RLS) Issues
- ❌ `Error creating storage bucket: StorageApiError: new row violates row-level security policy`
- ❌ Multiple 400 server errors due to RLS restrictions
- ✅ **Fixed**: Disabled RLS on all tables since admin dashboard is password-protected

### 3. Storage Bucket Issues
- ❌ `Failed to initialize Supabase storage`
- ❌ Images bucket not found
- ✅ **Fixed**: Created 'images' storage bucket with proper permissions

## Available Fix Scripts

### 1. `quick_fixes.sql` (Recommended)
**Use this for immediate fixes**
- Minimal script with essential fixes only
- Safe to run in production
- Fixes the core issues causing admin dashboard errors

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
-- Copy and paste the contents of quick_fixes.sql
```

### 2. `fix_database_issues.sql` (Comprehensive)
**Complete solution with additional improvements**
- Includes all fixes plus helpful additions
- Adds timestamp columns and triggers
- More detailed comments and verification queries
- Best for development/staging environments

### 3. `migrations/20250130_comprehensive_database_fixes.sql`
**Migration format for version control**
- Proper migration file format
- Can be applied via Supabase CLI
- Includes all essential fixes

## How to Apply Fixes

### Option A: Supabase Dashboard (Easiest)
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste contents of `quick_fixes.sql`
4. Click "Run"

### Option B: Supabase CLI
```bash
# Apply the migration
supabase db push

# Or apply specific migration
supabase migration up
```

### Option C: Manual Application
1. Connect to your database
2. Run the SQL commands from any of the fix scripts

## Verification

After applying fixes, verify they worked:

### 1. Check Admin Dashboard
- Navigate to `https://cometscanner.netlify.app/admin`
- Try uploading an image
- Check browser console for errors

### 2. Database Verification
```sql
-- Check that columns exist
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'templates' AND column_name = 'is_active';

SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'code_snippets' AND column_name = 'is_active';

-- Check RLS is disabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND rowsecurity = false;

-- Check storage bucket exists
SELECT * FROM storage.buckets WHERE id = 'images';
```

## Security Notes

### Why RLS Was Removed
- Admin dashboard is protected by password authentication
- All admin functions require login credentials
- RLS was preventing legitimate admin operations
- This is a common pattern for admin interfaces

### Storage Security
- Images bucket is set to public for display purposes
- Upload functionality is restricted to admin dashboard
- File size limited to 5MB
- Only image MIME types allowed

## Troubleshooting

### If fixes don't work:
1. Check Supabase project permissions
2. Verify you're connected to the correct database
3. Check for any remaining RLS policies:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'public';
   ```
4. Ensure storage bucket was created:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM storage.buckets;
   ```

### Common Issues:
- **Permission denied**: Make sure you have admin access to the Supabase project
- **Bucket creation fails**: May need to create bucket manually in Supabase dashboard
- **RLS still active**: Some policies might need manual removal

## Next Steps

After applying these fixes:
1. Test image upload functionality
2. Verify all admin dashboard sections work
3. Check that Node.js version alignment is correct (v22)
4. Monitor for any remaining console errors
